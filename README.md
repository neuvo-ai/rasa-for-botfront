# Rasa Addons

## rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontDisambiguationPolicy

This policy implements fallback and suggestion-based disambiguation.

It works with actions ``rasa_addons.core.actions.ActionBotfrontDisambiguation``, ``rasa_addons.core.actions.ActionBotfrontDisambiguationFollowup`` and ``rasa_addons.core.actions.ActionBotfrontFallback``, and NLU pipeline component ``rasa_addons.nlu.components.intent_ranking_canonical_example_injector.IntentRankingCanonicalExampleInjector``.

### Example usage

```yaml
policies:
  ...
  - name: rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontDisambiguationPolicy
    fallback_trigger: 0.30 # default value
    disambiguation_trigger: '$0 < 2 * $1' # default value
    disambiguation_template: 'utter_disambiguation' # default value
    n_suggestions: 2 # default value
    excluded_intents:
      - ^chitchat\..* # default value
      - ^basics\..*
  ...
```

### Note: Automatic generation of suggestion button titles

Botfront introduces the notion of "canonical" training examples, which provide a canonical human-readable text for intent labels. For example, for an intent ``pay_bills`` with examples "Pay bills", "I want to pay my bills", "How does one pay the bills on this website?", the first example may be selected as canonical. Canonical status serves as a cue to the bot designer, since intent labels can become untractable over time. It may also come to serve more Botfront-internal roles in the future.

The Botfront Disambiguation Policy uses canonical status to provide localized text for the suggestion buttons shown to users during disambiguation. In order to enable this feature, the NLU pipeline for each language model needs to be extended in the following way:

```yaml
pipeline:
  ...
  - name: rasa_addons.nlu.components.intent_ranking_canonical_example_injector.IntentRankingCanonicalExampleInjector
  ...
```

This NLU component enriches the ``intent_ranking`` key of user messages in the tracker with canonical text, so that the Disambiguation Policy may pick it up. If the NLU component is not used, buttons will have the intent name as their title.

### Parameters

##### fallback_trigger

Float (default ``0.30``): if confidence of top-ranking intent is below this threshold, fallback is triggered. Fallback is an action that utters the template ``utter_fallback`` and returns to the previous conversation state.

##### disambiguation_trigger

String (default ``'$0 < 2 * $1'``): if this expression holds, disambiguation is triggered. (If it has already been triggered on the previous turn, fallback is triggered instead.) Here this expression resolves to "the score of the top-ranking intent is below twice the score of the second-ranking intent". Disambiguation is an action that lets the user to choose from the top-ranking intents using a button prompt.

##### disambiguation_template

String (default ``'utter_disambiguation'``): a response name resolving to a template containing a ``text`` field with a message, e.g. "I could not quite understand. Did you mean...". Any button included under the ``buttons`` field of this template will also appear at the end of autogenerated suggestions, e.g. ``{"title": "None of the above", "type": "postback", "payload": "/deny_suggestions"}``.

##### n_suggestions

Int (default ``2``): the maximum number of suggestions to display (excluding the 'Other' options).

##### excluded_intents

List (default ``["^chitchat\..*", "^basics\..*"]``): any intent (exactly) matching one of these regular expressions will not be shown as a suggestion.

## rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontMappingPolicy

This policy implements regular expression-based direct mapping from intent to action.

### Example usage

```yaml
policies:
  ...
  - name: rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontMappingPolicy
    triggers:
      - trigger: '^map\..+'
        action: 'action_botfront_mapping'
        extra_actions:
          - 'action_myaction'
  ...
```

### ActionBotfrontMapping

The default action ActionBotfrontMapping takes the intent that triggered the mapping policy, e.g. ``map.my_intent`` and tries to generate the template ``utter_map.my_intent``.

## rasa_addons.core.channels.webchat.WebchatInput

### Example usage

```yaml
credentials:
  ...
  rasa_addons.core.channels.webchat.WebchatInput:
    session_persistence: true
    base_url: {{rasa_url}}
    socket_path: '/socket.io/'
  ...
```

### Running the Integration Tests

In order to run the integration tests, make sure that you have the development requirements installed:

```bash
make prepare-tests-ubuntu # Only on Ubuntu and Debian based systems
make prepare-tests-macos  # Only on macOS
```

Then, you'll need to start services with the following command which uses
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):

```bash
make run-integration-containers
```

Finally, you can run the integration tests like this:

```bash
make test-integration
```


### Resolving merge conflicts

## rasa_addons.core.channels.rest.BotfrontRestInput

Rest Input Channel with multilanguage and metadata support.

### Example usage

```yaml
credentials:
  ...
  rasa_addons.core.channels.rest.BotfrontRestInput:
    # POST {{rasa_url}}/webhooks/rest/webhook/
  ...
```

## rasa_addons.core.channels.bot_regression_test.BotRegressionTestInput:
Conversation testing channel. Simulates each user event in the input test stories as a message sent by a user, then compares the input story to the results from rasa. Returns a diff of the input story and output story with expected and actual events.

## Example usage

```yaml
credentials:
  ...
  rasa_addons.core.channels.bot_regression_test.BotRegressionTestInput: {}
    # POST {{rasa_url}} /webhooks/bot_regression_test/run
  ...
```

## rasa_addons.core.nlg.BotfrontTemplatedNaturalLanguageGenerator

Idential to Rasa's `TemplatedNaturalLanguageGenerator`, except in handles templates with a language key.

## rasa_addons.core.nlg.GraphQLNaturalLanguageGenerator

The new standard way to connect to the Botfront NLG endpoint. Note that support for the legacy REST endpoint is maintained for the moment. This feature is accessed by supplying a URL that doesn't contain the substring "graphql".

### Example usage

```yaml
endpoints:
  ...
  nlg:
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql'
    type: 'rasa_addons.core.nlg.GraphQLNaturalLanguageGenerator'
  ...
```
make types
```

### Deploying documentation updates

We use `Docusaurus v2` to build docs for tagged versions and for the `main` branch.
The static site that gets built is pushed to the `documentation` branch of this repo.

We host the site on netlify. On `main` branch builds (see `.github/workflows/documentation.yml`), we push the built docs to
the `documentation` branch. Netlify automatically re-deploys the docs pages whenever there is a change to that branch.

## Releases
### Release Timeline for Minor Releases
**For Rasa Open Source, we usually commit to time-based releases, specifically on a monthly basis.**
This means that we commit beforehand to releasing a specific version of Rasa Open Source on a specific day,
and we cannot be 100% sure what will go in a release, because certain features may not be ready.

At the beginning of each quarter, the Rasa team will review the scheduled release dates for all products and make sure
they work for the projected work we have planned for the quarter, as well as work well across products.

**Once the dates are settled upon, we update the respective [milestones](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/milestones).**

### Cutting a Major / Minor release
#### A week before release day

1. **Make sure the [milestone](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/milestones) already exists and is scheduled for the
correct date.**
2. **Take a look at the issues & PRs that are in the milestone**: does it look about right for the release highlights
we are planning to ship? Does it look like anything is missing? Don't worry about being aware of every PR that should
be in, but it's useful to take a moment to evaluate what's assigned to the milestone.
3. **Post a message on the engineering Slack channel**, letting the team know you'll be the one cutting the upcoming
release, as well as:
    1. Providing the link to the appropriate milestone
    2. Reminding everyone to go over their issues and PRs and please assign them to the milestone
    3. Reminding everyone of the scheduled date for the release

#### A day before release day

1. **Go over the milestone and evaluate the status of any PR merging that's happening. Follow up with people on their
bugs and fixes.** If the release introduces new bugs or regressions that can't be fixed in time, we should discuss on
Slack about this and take a decision to go forward or postpone the release. The PR / issue owners are responsible for
communicating any issues which might be release relevant.

#### Release day! 🚀

1. **At the start of the day, post a small message on slack announcing release day!**. Communicate you'll be handling
the release, and the time you're aiming to start releasing (again, no later than 4pm, as issues may arise and
cause delays)
2. Make sure the milestone is empty (everything has been either merged or moved to the next milestone)
3. Once everything in the milestone is taken care of, post a small message on Slack communicating you are about to
start the release process (in case anything is missing).
4. **You may now do the release by following the instructions outlined in the
[Rasa Open Source README](#steps-to-release-a-new-version) !**

### Steps to release a new version
Releasing a new version is quite simple, as the packages are build and distributed by GitHub Actions.

*Terminology*:
* micro release (third version part increases): 1.1.2 -> 1.1.3
* minor release (second version part increases): 1.1.3 -> 1.2.0
* major release (first version part increases): 1.2.0 -> 2.0.0

*Release steps*:
1. Make sure all dependencies are up to date (**especially Rasa SDK**)
    - For Rasa SDK that means first creating a [new Rasa SDK release](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-sdk#steps-to-release-a-new-version) (make sure the version numbers between the new Rasa and Rasa SDK releases match)
    - Once the tag with the new Rasa SDK release is pushed and the package appears on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/rasa-sdk/), the dependency in the rasa repository can be resolved (see below).
2. Switch to the branch you want to cut the release from (`main` in case of a major / minor, the current feature branch for micro releases)
    - Update the `rasa-sdk` entry in `pyproject.toml` with the new release version and run `poetry update`. This creates a new `poetry.lock` file with all dependencies resolved.
    - Commit the changes with `git commit -am "bump rasa-sdk dependency"` but do not push them. They will be automatically picked up by the following step.
3. Run `make release`
4. Create a PR against `main` or the release branch (e.g. `1.2.x`)
5. Once your PR is merged, tag a new release (this SHOULD always happen on `main` or release branches), e.g. using
    ```bash
    git tag 1.2.0 -m "next release"
    git push origin 1.2.0
    ```
    GitHub will build this tag and publish the build artifacts.
6. **If this is a minor release**, a new release branch should be created pointing to the same commit as the tag to allow for future patch releases, e.g.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b 1.2.x
    git push origin 1.2.x
    ```

### Cutting a Micro release

Micro releases are simpler to cut, since they are meant to contain only bugfixes.

**The only things you need to do to cut a micro are:**

1. Notify the engineering team on Slack that you are planning to cut a micro, in case someone has an important fix
to add.
2. Make sure the bugfix(es) are in the release branch you will use (p.e if you are cutting a `2.0.4` micro, you will
need your fixes to be on the `2.0.x` release branch). All micros must come from a `.x` branch!
3. Once you're ready to release the Rasa Open Source micro, checkout the branch, run `make release` and follow the
steps + get the PR merged.
4. Once the PR is in, pull the `.x` branch again and push the tag!
